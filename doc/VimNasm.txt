Overview:
  Assembly is probably my favorite language when coding for fun, my previous
editor was Scite with a modified ~/.SciTEUser.properties to make it into a
(sortof) IDE but daily use of vi has eventually pushed me to create this plugin.

Requirements:
  Nasm - my preferred assembler, feel free to replace with your own fav
  Ld   - standard linux linker
  Gdb  - built-in support for debugging asm is a bit rough, see recommendations

Recommendations:
  Gdbinit - https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit, I fiddled for quite some time
            making Gdb behave before finding this treasure. A lot of work has
            gone into it and it makes Gdb a great asm debugger - get it, you
            won't regret it.

Installation:
  Copy plugin/*.vim under ~/.vim/plugin/ and copy doc/* to ~/.vim/doc/

Details:
  I've never written a vim plugin before so I expect to hear people shaking
their heads saying "What is this PoS??" Unfortunately, I usually only do just
enough to make things functional so if you're expecting a polished work of art
this isn't it.

This plugin will map function keys as follows:

    F6: Compile
    F7: Link
    F8: Run
    F9: Debug

Obviously this won't work for everyone so as before, feel free to make it your
own. It currently searches the source for a BITS directive to determine the
output object file format (elf32|elf64), a better method is on the TODO list.

I decided to go with a quick background colour change (green) to notify on
successful compilation or linking and only pop up failure messages.

It also checks for the existence of artifacts from previous steps, so executing
a Run() won't do the compile and link steps unless required.
